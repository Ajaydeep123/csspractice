The clearfix, for those unaware, is a CSS hack that solves a persistent bug that occurs when two

 Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make 
 it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.
